# IndividualProject - Fishing Boat

Group Members: Karina Rovey


## Background
Fishing boat is a VR experience in which one can experience being on a boat in the middle of the ocean, fishing while sharks and fish circle the boat. This is meaningful to me as I spent long periods of time fishing with my family as a child. 

## Design
For this experience, I wanted the boat to look as similar to the boat that I grew up fishing on as possible. Additionally, the best fishing days are those with a beautiful, clear blue sky which I opted to include.
